With Oxid, online merchants or integration agencies get a lean, modern and feature rich PHP software to build up a sustainable e-commerce business.

Oxid is easy to customize: it uses the Smarty (alternatively Twig) template engine for generating oneâ€™s unique store front design. If you have to change or add some functionality for fitting OXID eShop into your business model, write an extension, put it into the modules folder and off you go.

Thanks to the OOP (object oriented programming) architecture youâ€™ll be able to update your software and benefit from the latest innovations without loosing your changes.

Because Oxid is so simple to adapt, there will be a short time to market â€“ Oxid is just e-commerce software for agencies with deadlines ðŸ™‚
